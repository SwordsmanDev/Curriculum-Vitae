    <h2>Gaming</h2>
    <p>
      Much like books or movies, gaming opens a portal to countless fantasy
      worlds where you can be anyone or anything you want. Additionally it is a
      great way to relax or develop skills such as Problem-solving or logical
      thinking, it is up to you to decide

    <h2>Hiking</h2>
    <p>
      There is a common saying: "nature is the greatest artist". What can be
      better than to choose a path and just walk, observing the world around
      you. Not to mention how great it is for your health.

    <h2>Gym</h2>
    <p>
      Gym is great way to take a break from your everyday life. Although
      primarily considered a place for body transformation, it is much more than
      that. Whenever I'm at the gym, my mind rests from everyday worries, the
      only thing that matters is the next set. I believe it is one of the best
      ways to train self-discipline.

    <h2>Cooking</h2>
    <p>
      The main purpose of food is to satisfy your hunger, but boy do I tell you,
      a well-prepared meal can get your day better. Whether do you want to treat
      yourself or somebody else, cooking is always a nice way express yourself.
      Not to mention that it is scientifically proven that cooking improves your
      motivation.
